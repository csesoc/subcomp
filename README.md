# subcomp
A project submission system for competitions.


## Setting Up

1. Install dependencies

    1. Install Rust

    The source of truth is https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

    ### Windows

    See https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html.

    ### MacOS, Debian Linux, Arch Linux

    ```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```


    2. Install Node

    The source of truth is https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

    # Windows

    See the source of truth.

    ## MacOS

    ```
    brew install node
    ```

    ### Debian Linux

    See: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md

    ### Arch Linux

    ```
    pacman -S nodejs npm
    ```


    3. Install PostgreSQL

    The source of truth is https://www.postgresql.org/download/.

    ### Windows

    See: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

    ### MacOS

    ```
    brew install postgresql
    ```

    ### Debian Linux

    ```
    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client
    ```

    ### Arch Linux
    
    ```
    pacman -S postgresql
    ```


2. Start PostgreSQL

    ### Arch Linux

    Switch to the `postgres` user and initialize the database cluster.

    ```
    sudo -u postgres â€“i  initdb -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'
    ```

    Exit the `postgres` user.
    
    ```
    exit
    ```

    Start the PostgreSQL service on every boot.
    
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable postgresql
    ```

    Start the PostgreSQL service.

    ```
    sudo systemctl start postgresql
    ```

    You can disable the starting the PostgreSQL service on every boot using:

    ```
    sudo systemctl disable postgresql
    ```


3. Create database

    Create a password for the `postgres` user.

    ```
    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# \password postgres
    [Enter a strong password]
    postgres#= \q
    ```

    Create a database

    ```
    createdb subcomp
    ```


4. Add secrets to .env file

    `$SUBCOMP` represents the working directory of this project.

    ```
    cd $SUBCOMP
    cd backend
    touch .env
    ```

    ### All environments

    Open `.env` and add the following:
    
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost/subcomp
    PASSWORD_SALT=RANDOM_STRING_HERE
    DOMAIN=https://www.example.com
    SMTP_USERNAME=example@gmail.com
    SMTP_PASSWORD=password
    PROJECT_END=2022-12-25T23:59:59+10:00
    VOTE_END=2023-01-02T23:59:59+10:00
    ```

    `DATABASE_URL` is a URL to connect to the database. The example URL should work for local development except replace `password` with the `postgres` user's password.

    `PASSWORD_SALT` must a long string consisting of letters and numbers for security reasons. KEEP THIS SECRET.

    `DOMAIN` is the domain the project is hosted on. It is used for sending emails.

    `SMTP_USERNAME` is an SMTP email account you have access to (it works for gmail). It is used fro sending emails.

    `SMTP_PASSWORD` is the password to the above account.

    `PROJECT_END` is a UTC timestamp for when submitting projects ends. The example value is in the AEST timezone.

    `VOTE_END` is a UTC timestamp for when voting on projects ends. The example value is in the AEST timezone.


4. Build frontend

    The frontend is statically served by the backend. Run these commands every time you want to rebuild the frontend.

    `$SUBCOMP` represents the working directory of this project.

    ```
    cd $SUBCOMP
    cd frontend
    yarn build
    rm -r ../backend/public || true
    mv build ../backend/public
    ```


3. Run backend

    Thanks to `rocket`, we use nightly Rust.

    ### First debug build

    ```
    rustup default nightly
    cargo update
    cargo build
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
    diesel setup
    diesel run migration # CAUTION: This will wipe the database.
    cargo run
    ```

    ### Subsequent debug builds

    ```
    cargo run
    ```

    ### First release build

    ```
    rustup default nightly
    cargo update
    cargo build --release
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
    diesel setup
    diesel run migration # CAUTION: This will wipe the database.
    cargo run --release
    ```

    ### Subsequent release builds

    ```
    cargo run --release
    ```
